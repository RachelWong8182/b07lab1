This lab introduces Java programming and Git/GitHub. 
Its purpose is to familiarize with compiling and running Java programs directly from the command line while practicing version control basics, such as creating a repository, 
cloning it, committing changes, and pushing code to GitHub. 
I will create a public GitHub repository named b07lab1, clone it to my machine, and use it to store my lab code. 
Regarding programming, this lab requires me to implement a simple Polynomial class in Java that represents polynomials using an array of coefficients. 
This class must include a constructor, methods for computing the sum of two polynomials, methods for evaluating a polynomial at a given value of x, and methods for checking whether a number is a root of the polynomial. 
The lab will test my implementation using the provided Driver class.
